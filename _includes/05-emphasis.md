I do **what** I can to be as *efficient* as possible. Work *smart*, **not** hard.

Im learning:
 1. Github
 2. HTML
 3. CSS

Looking forward to learning more. Then get a job to utilize these new skills. Well more then a job. If I find something I love to do, I wont work another day, in my life. ðŸŽ‰ This is my goal. ðŸ’š
